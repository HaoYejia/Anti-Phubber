# !Phubber
The cervical dieases of the public have became more and more servere since the beginning of 21th century. !Phubber (anti-phubber, 'anti-' for 'reverse' and 'phubber' for the guys who stuck into the smartphone all the time) is invented to remedy this issue. The angle of the bending neck is measured by a gyroscope on a side of the user's head as a wearable. Then, a calculation would be done base on the lenth of time and the degree the head is lowered by a chip. If it gets over a given limit, a viberating motor would be triggered to alarm the users to raise up the head instead of staring at the smartphone.
